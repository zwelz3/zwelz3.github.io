While I have little desire for these posts to primarily be about my life story, I cannot help but acknowledge that the only things of value we can say in life are the stories we share where we find meaning. For me, my stories are driven by my personal experiences and the challenges I have faced (and continue to face each day). So, while the purpose of this is to share my stories, I think it would be helpful to provide a little bit of context. 

My name is Zach, and I have a BS, MS, and PhD in Nuclear Engineering. During my research years, I transitioned to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Since graduating in 2017, I have been working for Georgia Tech Research Institute on projects related to knowledge science and human decision support. I have a fullfilling job, and my fellow peers would say that "[I] am on a path towards a long and meaningful career." The thing is, none of that *is ME*. My titles and position in *society* are important in ways that I don't completely understand, and I can acknowledge that my *persuit* of these titles has shaped who I am as a *person*. However, knowing these things about me as an *individual* tells you almost nothing of value outside the constructs of society. 

So, lets try this again. My name in Zach, and I am a chronic thinker. I was diagnosed as gifted and [ADHD](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/facts.html) at a young age. As a result of being very different, I was ostracized by my peers for much of my childhood. This forced me into a strange position at one of the most impressionable points in my life; I was an *observer* of life, rather than a participant. I was the kid sitting on the bleachers watching other kids play. I was the person *just outside* of the conversation; close enough to hear, but not allowed to participate. This isn't to say that I was not like other kids, or to say that my childhood was sad. Simply, I became someone who spent a majority of my time *watching* and *thinking*. My thoughts were pervaded with the desire to understand those who didn't accept me, and to use this knowledge to better myself in their eyes. 

If that wasn't enough already, my step-father at the time was a healthweb developer at the beginning of the dot-com era, and we moved from place to place each year as he would set up healthweb infrastructure for modern insurance companies. Each summer, we would move to another place and I would be forced to go through the entire process again: move to a new school, try to make friends, get pushed away for my quirks, spend my time learning and observing those around me, repeat. It wasn't until I was about 12 years old that I started to successfuly leverage what I had learned in order to be the person that I had been molding. In the years that followed (through an immense amount of effort) I started making friends and I was able to stop taking ADHD medication, but I never stopped being that observer. 

To this day, over a decade later, I have begun to understand myself. I have spent almost 30 years slowly getting closer to someone who understands who they are on the most fundamental level, and the one thing I understand above all else is that each of us struggle to reach this same end. We all want to understand who we are, and there is a path to get there. We are not always on the path, but our struggles are the journey we take to walk along it. 

So, while this post may not seem like a quick introduction to the person that is "Zach Welz", I hope that it will provide a lens that will help you see into the person behind these stories. At the end of the day, what I understand most about myself is that my thoughts are molded by the stories of my life and __not__ the other way around. I am shaped by them, which causes me to think the way that I do; it is the sum of my unique experiences in life that allows me to have my unique perspective. 

What I want to share... that is, what I want to *say*, cannot be completed. I cannot know the whole of the thing, because I cannot have thought of it completely, in every way. Rather, my goal is to tell a story. This story will not *explain* the things I believe, but, with a little bit of luck, this story will create an *opportunity* for you to see what I see, and __together__ we can begin to describe a new way of thinking. 

So, what am I? Surely not a nuclear engineer, beyond some years of education. Surely not a philosopher, beyond a simple educational title. Surely not a metaphysician or ideologist, beyond occasional (sometimes accidental) wisdom. 

I am simply an observer.
