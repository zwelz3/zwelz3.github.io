Welcome to a blog where I can share my thoughts and experiences as just one of many people in the world. I have always wanted to create a place where my mind can be shared with those I care about, and those who might also be interested in what I have learned. While I'm no millionaire businessman, social media influencer, or award winning scientist, I do have insight into the world through my own personal trials that I believe to be of some intrinsic value. I hope that what I share will provide meaning, entertainment, or provoke discussion in your own life. I also hope that this blog will foster communication that will help me continue to grow and expand my current mindfulness. Nothing is more valuable or worthwhile than opening up and sharing our minds, for they are what make us masters of the universe.

So, where to start? I've sat here contemplating where I want to begin my discussion. At first, I was convinced that I would share some small story from my life and intricately fold in a parable illustrating my own personal journey of growth. No matter how many ways I consider that story, it just sounds disingenuous. The purpose of this blog isn't to revel in the amazing complexity that is human though; the purpose is to *understand what life teaches us*. There is a time for explanation, and a time for contemplation. So, in the typical 2000s blogger fashion, I think I'll leave this initial entry on a quote. 

The Tao Te Ching is a Chinese text that originated around the 6th-century BC. While it is a famous religious text (fundamental Taoism), the book is simply the thoughts of a man who spent much of his time thinking about life. This text is especially meaningful to me, because it provides me with a constant awareness of the divide between society's complexity, and the simplicity of nature. In a world where we are suffocating under **all the noise**, the Tao provides raw material for internal growth. After thousands of years, it gives us encouragement that we may soon walk a path that bring us closer to a great life. 

> Embrace simplicity.

> Put others first.
>
> Desire little.

> <cite>Lao Tzu (*Tao Te Ching*)</cite>

Thank you for sharing this with me. Until next time, happy living.
