I've been working on a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/WelzPh) devoted to following influential people that focus on mindfulness, philosoph, self-care, etc. As I'm scrolling through literally thousands of accounts, I am noticing how many are dedicated to giving advice to their followers. What I've noticed in particular is that these accounts will have up-to millions of followers, but the posts will be something as generic as "Be kind to others" with thousands of likes, shares, and comments as if the *entire* population of humans on earth are not aware that being kind is a "good" thing. 

These types of posts that provide dollar-store advice may serve as positive uplifting reminders, yet in the scope of real life (not social media influence) they provide little to no value to anyone. **Why** should we be kind? **When**? To **whom**? What about **context**???

As humans, with all of our inherent flaws, we are not beings with a proven track record of correctly identifying underlying context; in our current world of instant gratification and one-liner motivational phrases, our advice typically falls into one of two categories: 

1. advice that does not accurately apply to a specific audience
2. advice that has devolved into something so arbitrarily ambiguous that it has almost no value

As a society, we have become obsessed with aesthetic to the point that we prefer something with no value that **looks** good, over something a bit messier, but that we might actually learn something from. And it's not just advice; a more obvious example is advertising. The entire industry is built around the exploitation of this aspect of human behavior. Instagram ads for shoddy products bring in millions of customers through the use of beautiful pictures of pretty people or unique locations. We fall gullible to the quick assumption that something so simple and aesthetic will enhance our life, rather than spend 30 minutes researching the best product for our specific and sometimes *unique* needs. 

Advice is no different. We have become a population that feeds on the hope that better times, more money, an easier life, and fewer problems are all a simple step away. In most cases, we are lying to ourselves (albeit not maliciously) that whatever it is that we desire will actually require hard work, self-sacrificing, etc. However, we have become so familiar with this world where everything promises a quick fix, an instant change, or cheap wisdom to solve our problems. The root issue is the false belief that we already "know" how to solve our problems; we just need a small push, some quick motivation, or a witty picture to help us remember.

The truth is a bit more involved. In many cases we **do** know how to change/improve/learn, but we are afraid of admitting to ourselves what it will cost. Nearly everything worthwhile in life uses the same currency: <ins>time</ins>. Learning a language, being healthier, getting an education, and making friends are just a few examples. Each takes a monumental amount of time (and effort) to make a reality, and the fact is that even 100 years of life on earth is not enough to do it all AND do the things we enjoy. We have to make strategic decisions to get the most out of life. In other cases, we do not actually know deep-down how to solve our problems. Marital issues, mental health, and money struggles are all things that the greater collection of humanity still does not have straightforward answers to. In some instances, this is because there is no answer that is "right", only different ways to make the best out of our unique situations. In other instances, it is because finding an answer (e.g. receiving advice from others) requires a great understanding of the underlying context of the problems. Why am I unhappy? Why is my marriage falling apart? What do I need to do to make more money? These are a sample of the near <ins>infinite</ins> complexity and vastness of context for our struggles. 

So, what should we turn to in lieu of bad advice? While there is no singular answer, we can look at the things that persist through history to help guide our decision. What we need, at the most basic level, is a place where we can think for ourselves with a guide that helps create the right environment and help protect us from wandering off too far from our goals. In this setting we can begin to unravel our unique context and better determine the right path to follow. We can begin to put our faith in our own ability to make good decisions for ourselves, and trust that we will be protected from anything too risky by our trusted guide. 

In modern society, these guides are often professionals with licenses, education, training and experience. While some people are adverse to the idea of using a therapist, these individuals are actually just guides for us to "solve" our own problems. For others, a useful guide may be a close friend, church leader, yogi, coach, etc. The important thing is that we do not accept advice from others as truth; rather, we see the advice as it applies to us as unique individuals, and use it to create our own unique solutions. 

If this all seems a bit obvious, or you believe that you are able to successfully follow your path with common ways of seeking advice from popular sources, <ins>that's okay</ins>. The goal isn't necessarily to change the way we do things, but to change the way we think about it. We are <ins>all</ins> incredibly smart beings and we have the power to face our problems and come up with our own answers. We just need to believe that we have this power, and work to exercise it in our own unique ways.
