*Note: this is an early draft release that has not yet undergone full review.*

When I was young, my mother always told me that I was destined for great things. She loved me beyond measure, and supported me no matter what I was interested in. Her pride in me was evident in her belief that I had no limits to what I could achieve. As a child, this had a profound impact on my early development, especially my ego. I'm not talking about the belief that people should worship the ground I walk on, rather the evolution of my cognitive delusion that I would somehow grow up to be the person that would solve the world's energy problems, cure cancer, or something equally implausible. The result of this expectation was the belief that I would have no value to the world unless I did something thought to be impossible; something that would forever change the way we live. This belief, to any particular extent, is a major factor in the general dissatisfaction that millions of people experience daily across the world, independent of individual circumstances. Lately, I've become more and more interested in exploring this concept in more detail. 

## The great delusion of self worth

Going back to 1997, I was diagnosed as "gifted" at the age of 5. My parents had high hopes that I was going to be extremely intelligent. They enrolled me in private education, and made sure that I had every opportunity to cultivate my knowledge and skills. At age 10 they had me reassessed and my IQ scored within the top 1%. Of course, this didn't mean anything to me as a child, but it had a large impact on my parents. I was constantly told how "special" and "unique" I was in contrast to other kids, and that I was going to grow up and change the world. Of course, now I know that none of this is true, and that I will likely never achieve any significant level of influence. I can't fault my parents for their hope in me, but now that I'm 30 and have a two-month old to care for, I have little desire or time to pursue anything drastic enough to significantly impact the world. It appears that their feelings are no different from millions of other parents that also hold the belief that their child is destined for greatness. 

Regardless of the prosaic reality that would eventually come to pass, I continued to impress in my formative years. I aced almost every advanced placement class through high school, and chose to pursue a degree in nuclear engineering from the University of Tennessee (a top 5 school in the US for graduate-level nuclear engineering at the time). I was graduating from a small-town school with a senior class of less than 200 students, and entering an accredited college with more than 20,000 attending. My mom was already telling anyone that would listen that her little boy was off to college to "discover a solution to the world's clean energy crisis," and that I was going to contribute to "the advancement of fusion reactor research". This couldn't be further from the truth (*sorry mom*). 

My first semester at college was a rude awakening. I quickly discovered that raw intelligence is no substitute for hard work, and graduating in the top 10 from a small-town high school doesn't translate to success at a large college. Suddenly, I was struggling to manage a normal college course load, whereas I barely worked at all during four years of high school. In my first year at university I struggled through nearly every class. I was forced to learn how to be better prepared, schedule my day, and how to study new material and truly understand what I learned. My struggles just barely paid off as I made the mark to graduate in the top 15% of my class. While the skills I gained during my bachelor's degree were worth the effort, the shift in my innate intelligence to one that required near constant effort resulted in an internal existential crisis. Even before I started my graduate program, I was no longer the most likely of my peers to change the world, and this led to a sharp decline in my confidence and assessment of my self-worth. For the first time in my life, I no longer believed that I would go on to do any of the world-changing things that I was made to expect as a child. Despite the respectable fact that I graduated *cum laude* with a BS in Nuclear Engineering, would go on to complete my MS and PhD in less than 4 years (the quickest PhD that year), and accepted an entry job position just shy of six-figures, I could only see myself and my life by the failures that would prevent me from ever being "great". I was painfully aware that I would most likely never change the world in any significant way. In fact, the job that I had accepted would likely create no positive impact on the world. If I wanted to cause an impact on others, I should have just gone into the service industry. 

Over the past few years, I have had a lot of time to reflect on my experiences. I've talked with others among my peers about their own experiences. I've discovered entire communities with others in my generation who were diagnosed gifted at a young age (like [this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/aftergifted/)). I spent hundreds of hours and many sleepless nights trying to better understand the value of my worth and where it would come from, now that I had accepted that my aspiration to greatness was likely not going to become a reality. In the end, I have decided that the idea of self-worth or the measurability of an individual's value is itself a troublesome delusion shared by much of the modern world. Through my experiences, my consumption of philosophical ideals, meditation, and shifting the perspective of how I view life, I am confident that there is absolutely no criteria for providing value and no requirement to meet it. Each of us *together* provide intrinsic value simply by existing as unique individuals with unique experiences. Together as collective humanity, we become the sum total of everything we are. There are many famous philosophers, religious leaders, yogi, etc. who have taught this very idea. As an analytical person, I enjoyed the process of formulating my own thoughts on this topic that I would like to share.

## The probability of our existence

Any modern documentary discussing the origins of humanity will start by talking about the great cosmic accident that resulted in "human life"; how amazingly unlikely it was that conditions were perfect to allow for life on earth, and the luck that they would remain stable long enough to allow evolution to produce creatures of such complexity. It can be very easy to take for granted just how lucky we are that any human life exists, simply because it appears to be constant from our self-centered perspective. In truth, the sheer implausibility of our existence only becomes more absurd the more you think about it. 

Let's consider the very basics of human biology. Most people learn about human reproduction at some point during their childhood. We know that men and women each provide a portion of their DNA (via a sperm and an egg) at conception. When we begin to think about the likelihood that each of us exists in the context of biological reproduction, it becomes clear how truly unlikely it is that you or I are the exact human that is alive and reading this right now. The probability that the exact sperm fertilized the exact egg that created the zygote that would become who you are now is already so small that we as humans struggle to truly comprehend it. Of course, the "unlikelihood" doesn't stop there; if we think about the likelihood that our biological donors were selected, that probability becomes comically infinitesimal. For the historically traditional couple (with a man and woman), what are the odds that those two people would meet, mate, and combine their DNA to produce you or I? That probability is dependent on every decision that both donors have ever made. They too were born of the same unlikelihood in terms of biological reproduction; therefore you are the compounding unlikelihood of your entire biological ancestry. 

But even that level of detail only begins to consider biological complexity. We all know the saying "nature versus nurture", which hints at the fact that, as humans, we are more than just the unique combination of our individual DNA; we are also a product of our environment, the way we are raised, and every conscious or unconscious decision that we make. Who we are is continuously changing as we participate in new experiences, make new decisions, and create new life of our own. And let's not forget that we also have an impact on those around us, thereby inextricably linking the state of our own existence to the connections we have with others (humans, animals, and even computers). 

Hopefully this hints at the probability of individual existence in a way that would make anyone appreciate their opportunity to live. At this point, we can (in some capacity) begin to comprehend how sheerly unlikely it is that you exist as the selfsame individual that you are within this universe; with your exact combination of DNA, experiences, beliefs, talents, ailments, etc. You can begin to accept the fact that the combination of everything that makes you "you" is so unlikely as to be only "explainable" as an improbable cosmic accident or happenstance. 

Of course you've probably already understood this on some level; throughout your life you've likely considered how different it would be if things had been even slightly different. What if I had stayed in a relationship with that ex? What if I had kids? What if I had chosen a different career? Human ego typically obfuscates the true scale of infinite possible alternate timelines by accepting most of this unlikeliness as baseline fact (which we promptly ignore). To better understand our value, we have to tackle a problem as old as humanity itself; to deconstruct our ego and the "truth of the self".

## Individuality: the truth of the "self"

It's always easier to discuss complex subjects when there is shared common ground. To start, let's go back to the assumption that we understand the basics of human reproduction, and simplify our earlier example to a particular union between two individuals that results in the conception of you or I as their offspring. Accepting the implausibility that a specific sperm fertilized a specific egg, let's consider the following question:

> What if it had been one of the (millions of) other sperm that fertilized the egg? Would the person that exists in your place still be you?

I think, for most people, our gut reaction is to say "absolutely not", for (as mentioned earlier) much of what makes us unique are our cumulative life experiences, and our DNA coding has an observable impact on our lives (e.g. intelligence, attractiveness, illness). However, it is my personal opinion that, with more consideration, the question is a bit more difficult to answer definitively. In this theoretical example, the person in our place still has (at least) half the same DNA via the egg's chromosomes. This means our "alternate" would share similarities with us in many ways. We can see this to a lesser extent in traditional biological siblings, and to a greater extent in the existence of identical twins. Obviously, this does not make them the "same" person as us, but there is some non-zero amount of sameness that cannot be ignored at the DNA level, and there are likely additional similarities in our shared environments and mutual experiences. 

To complicate the question a bit more, imagine (through some microscopic shift in cosmic chance) that your "mother and father" each conceived a child with a different partner, but that the same exact sperm and egg that resulted in you contributes to the existence of these two unique individuals. Would you no longer exist? Would part of you exist in both entities that were born to two disparate families? I think, at this point, the idea that we are our DNA becomes more obscure and we cannot ignore the fact that who we are (at an existential level) must be largely influenced by our experiences in life. In order to decompose this idea of the *self* as the combination of these experiences, we will consider another line of thinking. 

You've entertained my notion that your existence is the combination of the probability of your DNA, as well as the likelihood that your parents, through every decision they made in life, would eventually bring them together at your moment of conception. As their offspring, the path of your life is equally incredible; each of our lives can be defined at the highest level as the combination of every decision at each moment given the specific state of our being: DNA, environment, external influences, and other hidden factors. This means that, at its most complex, what makes you "you" consists of the combination of every decision you have ever made, with the current "state" of your life at that moment. You would not be the exact same person if you had made any decision differently any more than you would be exactly the same if you had even a single different nucleotide in your DNA. The realization becomes clear that who we <i>identify as</i> is significantly more shallow than who we <i>are</i>. What we <i>are</i> is the absolute accumulation of all probabilities for our genetic combination and sequence of experiences and decisions that aggregate into a continuous set of discrete states that we cannot even begin to fathom the dimensionality of. However, who we <i>identify as</i> is significantly less complex; we would likely accept the belief that we are the same person if we had instead chosen a different shirt to wear today, but that we are distinctly different from a version of ourselves that would choose to step outside and murder an innocent person in cold blood. 

Together, all of this supports the idea that we are not simply the combination of our genes, or the exact sum of our life's experiences; we are not the same as a twin, or different than alternative versions of ourselves whose differences are inconsequential in the larger context of who we believe we are. In fact, the idea of the "self" is merely an arbitrary set of boundaries drawn in some multi-dimensional space that constrain the space where the combinatorial instance of your DNA and all your experiences exist. The level of complexity with which we draw this boundary is the fidelity that we require to disambiguate ourselves from any other individual. If you still see yourself the same if you chose a different meal for lunch today or a different hat, then that particular attribute or experience does not become part of your "self". How does our desire for individuality change the way we build our identity? 

## Seeing beyond disambiguation inimical to self-identity

The beginning of life is a whirlwind of new experiences and rapid growth, both physically and mentally. The primary mechanism of learning at an early age is the ability to disambiguate between things. Most people alive today will remember that toy where you have to put different shaped blocks into different shaped holes: square vs triangle, red vs blue, big vs small. This not only teaches us how to understand things in relation to one another, but how to discover useful features of individual things that set them apart. We learn how to distinguish between hot and cold, light and dark, mom and dad, food and not food. As we age, we use this ability to form a foundation of judgment; that is to say, we use our ability to disambiguate to make decisions.

<br/>

As we grow older, the frequency of new experiences decreases and we become increasingly inflexible to this process of learning. We form firmer ideals that turn into stubborn opinionated behavior and beliefs. This can lead to closed-mindedness and unjust bias depending on the diversity of our early life, and is likely related to harmful prejudices including racism, sexism, classism, etc. It's not surprising that a white male raised in 40s rural Alabama would learn to identify a means of separating himself from his fellow man on the basis of skin color. He is undeniably racist, but the root cause of his ignorance is on some level connected to a deficiency in experience with cultures including people of color. His pool of experiences that define who he is and how he thinks cannot teach him that peoples with a different culture, orientation, community, and other arbitrary ways of segregating humanity are no different than himself. His entire system of measuring value is skewed by a general lack of awareness for the reality of the world, which cannot begin to fit within such a narrow mind.

So it becomes increasingly apparent that the question is "how do we see beyond this instinctual  disambiguation?" The goal is to better understand the value of all humans despite things like race, social class, education, religion, background, gender, height, attractiveness, and talent. The answer is likely much simpler than the problem makes it seem. Similar to learning the secret that demystifies a convincing illusion, once we as humans educate ourselves to the evolutionary mechanisms that cause this effect to occur, we can identify its pattern or signature in our own thoughts. The following are two simplified examples of ideas from my own life with inimical bias, born from learning ineffective and harmful ways to disambiguate.

1. As a child, I was bullied relentlessly by a small group of classmates. As someone living in a small town, many of these childhood bullies grew up to lead largely quiet lives as decent people in that very same town. I, however, chose to go to college in the city, received multiple degrees, and "earned" respect from others. As a result, I impulsively assume that lesser educated individuals have a larger capacity for maliciousness towards me. This is obviously flawed as evident by the countless experiences I have had with lesser-educated people in my adult life, where I have seen by their capacity for love, kindness, wisdom, and positivity. 

2. I have a diagnosably unhealthy opinion of aesthetics. Anyone with a TV or the internet knows that beautiful people, places, and things are used to convince us that anything of value is as close to perfection as it gets. Muscular men are used to sell supplements, and beautiful women are used to sell makeup. By devaluing non-aesthetically pleasing life in our art, media and advertising, this toxic belief that value is related to looks or appearances has become seemingly insurmountable; I find myself buying the $3 water with a fancy label over simply refilling my reusable bottle, or I catch myself following an Instagram account with a biologically inclined bodybuilder who posts impressive photos instead of finding athletes who share their wisdom so that I can actually learn something. 

In the end, the solution is to realize that we are impressionable, and that the value of something is rarely perceptible without true understanding; there are no shortcuts to identifying this value. We need to experience for ourselves, engage with those who we believe are different from ourselves, and be as open-minded as possible in order to see the true nature of the world. We should account for our bias and not just ignore it. We have to accept that the circumstances of our youth have created opportunities that others may not have received. And we must discern how millions of years of evolution-driven cognitive behavior influence the way we perceive the world, if we ever truly want to understand the value of everyone in it. 

## Value through human exploration

If you're still reading, you may be asking how this discussion actually helps us have a greater appreciation for others. This entire post boils down to one central idea on the value of humanity: each of us is the unique combination of our DNA and life experience. The same life is never lived twice. Therefore, every single person changes the answer to a question that has been asked since the dawn of humanity: "What is humanly possible?" Every life, every decision is an opportunity to continue this infinite game of human exploration. When we see ourselves differently than those around us, it is because evolution has taught us the optimal <i>biologically self-important</i> way to disambiguate, but on the cosmic scale, we are all extremely similar. It's possible that you may be incapable of seeing the value of a restaurant employee that messes up your order over that of a successful neurosurgeon, but this is an archaic opinion based on misguided beliefs about the *purpose* of humanity, or pathetic compensation for low confidence in oneself. Personal ego causes us to cherish that which sets us apart, but each person that is, was, or ever will be is similar to us in a non-zero number of ways; we all share commonality. The value of human life has never been in the individual against all others, as we sometimes fantasize about via pop culture, but in the idea that, together, <i>every single individual</i> contributes to and expands what is humanly possible. We are all a small finite sliver of the infinite game, and our value is that, together, we can redefine our own limits. 

Thanks for reading.
