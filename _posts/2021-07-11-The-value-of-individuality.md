*Note: this is an early draft release that has not yet undergone full review.*

When I was a young child, my mother always told me that I was destined for great things. She loved me so much and supported me no matter what I was interested in. Her pride in me was evident in the belief that I had no limits in what I could achieve. As a child, this had a profound impact on my early development, especially my ego. I'm not talking about the belief that people should worship the ground I walk on (i.e. narcissism), rather the evolution of my cognitive delusion that I would somehow grow up to be the person that would solve the world's energy problems, cure cancer, or something equally implausible. It was the result of this expectation that created a belief in myself that I would have no value to the world unless I did something thought to be impossible, or that would forever change the way we live. This belief, to any level of attention, is a major factor in the general dissatisfaction that millions of people experience daily across the world; independent of individual circumstances. I have become increasingly interested in exploring this concept in more detail as it pertains to all people. 

## The great delusion of self worth

Going back to 1997, I was diagnosed as "gifted" at the age of 5. My parents had high hopes that I would grow to be extremely intelligent. They enrolled me in private education, and made sure that I had every possible opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills. At age 10, I was reassessed and my IQ scored within the top 1%. Of course, this meant very little to me as a child, but caused a //profound// impact on my parents. I was constantly told that I was "special" and "unique" from other kids, and that I would grow up to change the world. Of course, now I know that this is not true, and that I will likely never achieve any significant level of notoriety. I can't fault my parents for their hope in me, but now that I'm 30 and have a tiny 2-month old child to care for, I have little desire or time to do anything drastic enough to significantly impact the world. It appears that their feelings are no different from millions of other parents that also hold the belief their child is destined for greatness. 

Regardless of the harsh reality that would come to pass, as I grew up I continued to impress. I aced each advanced placement class through high school, and chose to pursue a degree in nuclear engineering from the University of Tennessee (top 5 in the US for graduate-level nuclear engineering). I was graduating from a small-town school with a senior class of less than 200 students, and entering an accredited college with more than 20,000 attending. At this point, my mom was already telling everyone that her little boy was off to college to "discover a solution to the world's clean energy crisis," and that I would likely contribute to "the advancement of fusion reactor research." This could not have been further from the truth (<i>sorry mom</i>). 

My first semester at UT was a rude awakening. I quickly discovered that raw intelligence is no substitute for hard work, and graduating in the top 10 from a small-town high school doesn't translate to success at a college with over 20,000 students. Suddenly, I was struggling to manage a college course load, whereas I barely spent any effort in all four years of high school. In my first year at university, I struggled through nearly every class. I learned how to be better prepared, schedule my day, and how to study new material and truly understand what I learned. My struggles paid off as I barely made the mark to graduate in the top 15% of my class. While the skills I gained during my bachelor's degree were worth the effort, the shift in my innate intelligence to one that required near constant effort caused an existence crisis within me. Even before I started my graduate program, I was no longer the most likely of my peers to change the world, which led to a sharp decline in confidence of my own self-worth. For the first time in my life, I no longer believed that I would go on to do any of the world-changing things that I was made to expect as a young child. Despite the respectable fact that I graduated <i>cum laude</i> with a BS in Nuclear Engineering, would go on to complete my MS and PhD in less than 4 years (the quickest PhD that year), and accepting an entry job position just shy of six-figures, I could only see myself and my life by the number of failures that would prevent me from ever being "great". I was painfully aware that I would most likely never change the world in any significant way. In fact, the job that I had accepted would likely create less positive impact on the world, than if I had simply gone into the service industry. 

Over the past few years, I have had a lot of time to reflect on my experiences. I've talked with many of my peers about their own experiences. I've discovered entire communities with others in my generation who were diagnosed gifted at a young age (like this subreddit TODO r/aftergifted). I spent hundreds of hours and many sleepless nights trying to better understand the value of my worth and where it should come from now that I had accepted that my aspiration to greatness was likely not going to become a reality. In the end, I've decided that the ideas of self-worth or the measurability of an individual's value is itself a terrifying delusion shared by much of the modern world. Through my experiences, my consumption of philosophical ideals, meditation, and shifting the perspective of how I view life, I am confident that there is absolutely no criteria for providing value and no requirement to meet it. Each of us <i>together</i> provide intrinsic value simply by existing as unique individuals with unique experiences. Together as collective humanity, we become the sum total of everything we are. There are many famous philosophers, religious leaders, yogi, etc. who have taught this very idea. As an anlytical person, I have enjoyed the process of shaping my own thoughts on this topic that I would like to share.

## The probability of our existence

Any modern documentary discussing the origins of humanity will start by talking about the great cosmic accident that has become "human life"; how amazingly unlikely it is that conditions were perfect to allow for life on earth, and the luck that they would remain stable long enough to allow evolution to produce creatures as complex as we are. It can be very easy to take for granted just how lucky we are that <i>any</i> human life exists because it appears as a given opportunity from our self-centered perspective. But in truth, the shear implausibility of our existence only becomes more outrageous the more you think about it. 

Let's consider basic biology. Most people learn about human reproduction during their childhood education. We know that men and women each provide a portion of their DNA (via sperm and egg) at conception. Throughout their lives, men create new sperm every day; whereas women have a set amount of eggs at birth, and release one a month until they are beyond child-bearing age. When we begin to think about the likelihood that each of us exists in the cotet of biological reproduction, it becomes obvious how truly unlikely it is that you or I are the exact human that is alive and reading this right now. The probability that the exact sperm fertilized the exact egg that created the zygote that would become who you are now is already so small that we as humans struggle to truly comprehend it. Of course, the "unlikelihood" doesn't stop there; if we think about the probability that our biological donors were selected, the probability becomes comically infinitesimal. For the historically traditional couple (with a man and woman), what are the odds that those two people would meet, mate, and combine their DNA to produce you or I? That probability is dependent on every decision that both donors have ever made. Of course, they were also born of the same unlikelihood in terms of biological reproduction; therefore you are the compounding unlikelihood of your entire biological ancestry. 

But if only it were that "simple". We all know the saying "nature versus nurture", which hints at the fact that, as humans, we are more than just the unique combination of our individual DNA; we are also a product of our environment, the way we are raised, and every conscious or unconscious decision that we make. Who we are is continuously changing as we participate in new experiences, make new decisions, and create new life of our own. Let's not forget that we also have an impact on those around us, thereby inextricably linking the state of our own existence to the connections we have with others (humans, animals, and even computers). 

Hopefully this begins to outline a sketch of the probability of individual existence. At this point, we can (in some capacity) begin to appreciate how sheerly unlikely it is that you exist as the selfsame individual that you are within this universe; with your exact combination of DNA, experiences, beliefs, talents, ailments, etc. We should begin to accept the fact that the combination of everything that makes you "you" is so unlikely as to be only "explainable" as an improbable cosmic accident or happenstance. 

Of course you probably already understood this on some subconscious level; throughout your life you have likely thought about how different it would be if things had been even slightly different. What if I had stayed in a relationship with that ex? What if I had kids? What if I had chosen a different career? Human ego typically obfuscates the true scale of infinite alternate timelines by accepting most of this unlikeliness as baseline fact (which we promptly ignore). To better understand our value, we must tackle a problem as old as humanity itself; to deconstruct our ego and the "truth of the self".

## Individuality: the truth of the "self"

It is always easier to discuss complex subjects when there is shared common ground. To start, let's go back to the assumption that we understand the basics of human reproduction and simplify our earlier example to a particular union between two individuals that results in the conception of you or I as their offspring. 

At this point, we can accept the implausibility that a specific sperm fertilized a specific egg; I would like to post a question:

> What if it had been one of the (millions of) other sperm that fertilized the egg? Would the person that exists in your place still be you?

I think, for many people, our gut reaction is to say "surely not", for (as mentioned earlier), much of what makes us unique are our cumulative life experiences, and our DNA coding has an observable impact on our lives (think intelligence, attractiveness, illness, etc.). However, it is my personal opinion, with more consideration, that the question is a bit more difficult to answer definitively. In this theoretic example, the person in our place still has (at least) half of our same DNA via the egg's chromosomes. This means our "alternate" would share similarities with us in many ways. We can see this to a lesser extent in traditional biological siblings, and to a greater extent in the existence of identical twins. Obviously, this does not make them the "same" person as us, but there is some non-zero amount of similarity that cannot be ignored on a DNA level, and likely has additional connections in our shared environments and mutual experiences. 

To complicate the question a bit more, imagine (through a small shift in cosmic chance) that your "mother and father" each conceived a child with a different partner, but that the same exact sperm and egg that resulted in you contributes to the existence of these two unique individuals. Would you no longer exist? Would part of you exist in both entities that were born to two disparate families? I think, at this point, the idea that we are our DNA becomes more obscure and we cannot ignore the fact that who we are (at an existential level) must be largely influenced by our experiences in life. In order to decompose this idea of the "self" as the combination of these experiences, we should consider another line of thinking. 

You've entertained my notion that our existence is the combination of the probability of our DNA from conception, as well as the likelihood that your parents, through every decision they made in life, would eventually bring them together at such a precise moment. We as individuals are no different; our lives can be assessed at the highest level as the combination of every decision at each moment given the specific state of our being: DNA, environment, external influences, and other hidden factors. This means that, at its most complex, what makes you "you" consists of the combination of every decision you have ever made, with the current "state" of your life at that moment. You would not be the <i>exact same person</i> if you had made any decision differently any more than you would be exactly the same if you had even a single different nucleotide in your DNA. The realization becomes clear that who we <i>identify as</i> is significantly more shallow than who we <i>are</i>. We <i>are</i> the precise accumulation of all probabilities for our generic combination and sequence of experiences and decisions that aggregate into a continuous set of discrete states that we cannot even begin to fathom the dimensionality of. However, who we <i>identify as</i> is a much smaller order space; for we would likely accept the belief that we are the same person if we had instead chosen a different shirt to wear today, but that we are distinctly different from a version of ourselves that would choose to step outside and murder an innocent person in cold blood. 

Together, all of this supports the idea that we are not simply the combination of our genes, or the exact sum of our life's experiences; we are not the same as a twin, or different then alternative selves whose differences we believe to be inconsequential in the greater context of who we are. In fact, the idea of the "self" is merely an arbitrary set of boundaries drawn in multi-dimensional space that constrain the projected space where the sum of all combinatorial instances of your DNA and human experience exist. The level of complexity with which we draw this boundary is the fidelity that we require to disambiguate ourselves from any other individual. If you still see yourself the same if you chose a different for lunch today or a different hat, then the attribute or experience does not become part of your "self". 

<!--- Do I need to explicitly tie this back to "individuality"? -->

## Seeing beyond disambiguation inimical to self-identity

The beginning of life is a whirlwind of new experiences and rapid growth, both physically and mentally. The primary mechanism of learning at an early age is the ability to disambiguate between things. Most people alive today will remember that one toy where you have to put different shaped blocks into different shaped holes: square vs triangle, red vs blue, big vs small. This teaches us not only how to understand things in relation to one another, but also how to discover useful features of individual things that set them apart. We learn how to distinguish between hot and cold, light and dark, mom and dad, food and not food. As we age, we use this ability to form a foundation of judgment; that is to say, we use our ability to disambiguate to make decisions.

<br/>

As we grow older, the frequency of new experiences decreases and we become increasingly inflexible to this process of learning. We form firmer ideals that turn into stubborn opinionated beliefs/behavior. This can lead to extreme closed-mindedness and bias depending on the diversity of our early life, and is likely related to harmful prejudice including racism, sexism, classism, etc. It's not surprising that a white male raised in 40s rural Alabama would learn to identify a means of separating himself from his fellow man on the basis of skin color. He is undeniably racist, but the root cause of his ignorance is on some level connected to a deficiency in experience with cultures including people of color. His pool of experiences that define who he is and how he thinks cannot teach him that peoples with a different culture, orientation, community, and other arbitrary ways of segregating humanity are no different than himself. His entire system of measuring value is skewed by a general lack of awareness for the reality of the world, which cannot begin to fit in such a narrow mind.

So it becomes increasingly obvious that the question is "how do we see beyond this instinctual  disambiguation?" The goal is to better understand the value of all humans despite race, social class, education, religion, background, gender, height, attractiveness, talent... The answer is much simpler than the problem makes it seem. Similar to learning the secret that demystifies a complicated illusion, once we as humans educate ourselves to the evolutionary mechanism that causes this effect to occur, we can identify its pattern or signature in our own thoughts. The following are two simplified examples of ideas from my own life with inimical bias, born from learning ineffective and harmful ways to disambiguate in my own life.

1. As a child, I was regularly bullied by a few of my peers. As someone living in a small town, many of the bullies from my childhood grew up to lead largely quiet lives as decent people in that very same town. I, however, went to college in the city, received multiple degrees, and "earned" respect from others. As a result, I typically assume that lesser educated individuals have a larger capacity for maliciousness in the context of the mutual well-being of others. This is obviously flawed as evidence by the countless experiences I have had with lesser-educated (and uneducated) people in my adult life that serve as made evident by their capacity for love, kindness, intelligence, and positivity. 

2. I have a diagnosably unhealthy opinion of aesthetics as part of the modern world. Anyone with a TV or the internet knows that beautiful people, places, and things are used to convince us that anything of value is as close to perfection as it gets. Muscular men are used to sell supplements, and beautiful women are used to sell makeup. By devaluing non-aesthetically pleasing life in our art, media and advertising, this toxic belief that value is related to "looks" or appearances has become something that I cannot easily ignore; buying a $3 water with a fancy label over simply refilling my reusable bottle, or following Instagram accounts with biologically inclined bodybuilders who post photos over smart athletes who share their wisdom that I may actually learn something from. 

In the end, the solution is to realize that we are impressionable, and that none of these things are the true value of anything. There are no shortcuts to identifying value. We must experience for ourselves, engage with those who we believe are different from ourselves, and be as open-minded as possible in order to see the world how it really is. We must account for our bias and not just ignore it. We must understand how the circumstances of our youth have created opportunities that others may not have received. We must understand how millions of years of evolution-driven cognitive behavior influence the way we perceive the world if we truly want to understand the value of everyone in it. 

## Value through human exploration

If you are still reading, you may be asking how all of this actually helps us have a greater appreciation for others. You may not yet be capable of seeing the value of a restaurant employee that messes up your order over that of a successful neurosurgeon. This entire post boils down to one central idea on the value of humanity: each of us is the unique combination of our DNA and life experience. The same life is never lived twice. Therefore, every single person changes the answer to a question that has been asked since the dawn of humanity: "What is humanly possible?" Every life, every decision is an opportunity to continue this infinite game of human exploration. When we see ourselves differently than those around us, it is because evolution has taught us the optimal <i>biologically self-important</i> way to disambiguate, but on the cosmic scale, we are all extremely similar. Our personal ego leads us to cherish what sets us apart, but each person that is, was, or ever will be is similar to us in a non-zero number of ways; we all share commonality. The value of human life has never been in the individual against all others, as we sometimes fantasize about via pop culture, but in the idea that, together, <i>every single individual</i> contributes to and expands what is humanly possible. We are all a small finite sliver of the infinite game, and our value is that, together, we can redefine our own limits. 

Thanks for reading.
